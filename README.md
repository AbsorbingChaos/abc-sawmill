# Sawmill: A Modular Layout Builder for Hugo and Forestry.io

[Read the announcement post on Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/blog/sawmill-layout-composer-for-hugo-and-forestry/#/)

## Installation
I recommend adding this theme as a submodule

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/dwalkr/sawmill.git themes/sawmill
```

`config.toml`:
```toml
theme = "sawmill"
```
